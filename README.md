This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an array or vector index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to access an index beyond the valid range of a vector, which will cause a runtime panic. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version of the code, showcasing how to safely handle potential out-of-bounds errors using the `.get()` method or other safe indexing techniques.
